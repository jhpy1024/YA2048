Yet Another 2048 Clone

NOTE: The code at the moment is messy. I'm getting the game working first and will then focus on making the code look nice and pretty!

How to build
======

* Make sure you have SFML installed (I think this will need to be in your PATH) and the development versions of the dependencies of SFML. If you compiled SFML you should have no problem in this area.
* Install premake4
* Download the repository
* Run premake4 from the root directory, specifying the target platform:
  Example: `premake4 gmake` for GNU makefiles. For a list of target platforms see [here](http://industriousone.com/premake-quick-start)
* Build the project. Example for GNU makefiles: `make`

If you need any help building the project, feel free to e-mail me at jhpy1024@gmail.com
